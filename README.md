About

This is a Mac OS X keyboard for the [Pema Ts'al orthagraphic system](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/pema_tsal_fonts). It is based on the free and open source [Monlam Bod-yig](http://lobsangmonlam.org/Product.html) by Lobsang Monlam.

Modifications were made using the open source software [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele), distributed by SIL International.
